  <h2 style="margin-top:0">Culture notes</h2>
  <p><strong>Autonomy.</strong> I ship end-to-end: define the experiment, build it, instrument it, share learnings.</p>
  <p><strong>Transparency.</strong> Every agent or workflow gets dashboards, eval metrics, and an ops guide.</p>
  <p><strong>Weirdness.</strong> Expect Easter eggs and human touches that make complex systems approachable.</p>
