  <h2 style="margin-top:0">Hi PostHog — I’m Dragutin</h2>
  <p>
    I’m an AI product engineer who ships instrumented features end-to-end. I love
    building useful automation, measuring what matters, and iterating fast.
  </p>
  <p>
    I spent 6 years as a data engineer and 2 years focused on GenAI. Recently I led AI
    development for an enterprise product using hybrid RAG and a multi‑agent workflow.
    I’m fluent in Python and very comfortable around data — that’s how I got deep into LLMs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your mix of transparency, autonomy, and playful craft resonates with me. I want to help
    teams understand and debug LLM systems with open‑source tools — exactly what this role
    promises.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you value fast learning, clear instrumentation, and shipping without waiting for approvals,
    I’m in.
