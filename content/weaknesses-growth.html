  <p>
    I’m not strong in modern FE frameworks. I’m transparent about this and proactive:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Weeks 1–2:</strong> ship a small UI tweak to this desktop; ramp on React/TypeScript basics.</li>
    <li><strong>Weeks 3–4:</strong> co-own a simple UI for an LLM trace viewer; pair with a teammate.</li>
    <li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> keep FE skills good-enough to ship product slices without blocking.</li>
  </ul>
